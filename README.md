The Yahoo! Movies User Ratings and Descriptive Content dataset contains information based on
Yahoo! Account holders who reviewed certain movies and rated their performance. This data set
includes many different data, including: year of release, length of movie, MPAA rating, reasons for
MPAA rating, name of director, GNPP, and other related info. Two additional datasets contain rater
related information, including rater birth year, gender, movie ID and ratings. In this project, we
explored the relationship between movie genre, movie rating, MPAA rating and gender.
